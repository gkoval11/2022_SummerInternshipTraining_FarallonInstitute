# 2022 Summer Internship Training - Farallon Institute

Training scripts and data for the 2022 Summer Internship at the Farallon Institute

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gkoval11/2022_SummerInternshipTraining_FarallonInstitute/main)

## Objectives

This tutorial aims to provide a common ground in python for the summer interns at the Farallon Institute. The scripts here cover topics such as Jupyter Notebooks, Github, the basics of Python, data structures in python, the Xarray package and netcdf file types, the Matplotlib package and plotting data, and then some useful examples relevant to the projects you'll be working on.

## How it works

There are eight separate chapters that go through the different objects. This repository uses the my binder service to create an instance of Jupyter notebooks in the cloud so all those participating will be using the same versions of each package and won't be required to install anything additional. Click on the my binder icon at the top of the readme file to launch the binder. It may take a while to get going, but once it starts, you should be able to run all the scripts from there. **Warning, any changes to make to the scripts or data will not be saved through the mybinder instance**.
